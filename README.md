*Game-Based Assessment of Big Five*

<br/>

This repository contains the source code for GAB5, which is part of the [GADP project](https://projects.tuni.fi/game-based-assessment/).

The source code consists of two main projects: [`/OceanProto`](/OceanProto), a game client for Windows and HTML5, and [`/ocean-www`](/ocean-www), a backend server that the game client communicates with. See those directories' readmes for further information on each of them.
